    " Sure, imagine you have two friends - one friend is much stronger than the other. The strong friend can jump really high and far on their trampoline. But if the weak friend tries to do the same thing, they'll just bounce up and down but never go very far or high.\nNow, think of these friends as two different galaxies. One galaxy has a super massive star at its center that's so big it's like a giant ball of energy (a black hole). This black hole is so dense that anything that comes too close to it will get sucked in and never come out again because nothing can escape from inside it. It"

    "\n\n**Contextlib Version:** 3.0\n\n**Description:**\n\nThis provides a concise and efficient way to handle temporary files in Python. It leverages the `contextlib` module for better handling of file operations, including file creation, modification, and deletion.  It also includes robust error handling and logging.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\nimport contextlib\n\ntry:\n    # Create a temporary file\n    with open(\"my_temp.txt\", \"w\") as temp_file:\n        temp_file.write(\"This is the first line of the file.\")\n\n    # Delete the file\n    ",
